The actor is taken here in the sense of a human or an instituion entity which has some sort of relationship with an artwork. Specific documentation of elements of an actor depends highly upon the kind of actor it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an actor and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC-CRM or custom fundamental relationships. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including:</p> <ul> <li>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common expression.</li> <li>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns.</li> </ul> <p>The CIDOC-CRM entity E39 Actor was used for the semantic annotation of the Artists, Persons, Photographesrs as well as for the Institutions. In order to distinguish these four, custom categories were created, the Artist category (fc:artist),the Person category (fc:person),the Photgrapher category (fc:photographer) and the Institution category (fc:institution), which were used to represent the Artists, Persons, Photogrpahers and Institutions respectively.</p> <p>For the better understanding of the representing data, it has been divided into two sections which are analyzed.
