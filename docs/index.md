The ArtResearch project uses a semantic web infrastructure to record and expose reference resources useful for Digital Art History & Digital Humanities projects.

The model documentation is devided into these main categories:

1. Ontological Modelling Patterns
2. Reference Data Models


## __Ontological Modelling Patterns__

The modelling patterns are a series of generalisable formulas for the modelling of entities and their properties  used within Artresearch. The patterns provided here always come from a real use-case scenarios and are made explicit both using a Turtle (.ttl) file and a graphical output.

## __Reference Data Models__

With the term Reference Data Models we denote a re-usable template of common descriptors grounded on the analysis of select sources determined to be of relevance to the entity being modelled.

Each available template is a collection of descriptors for a specific entity, and each descriptor is mapped to the [CIDOC-CRM](cidoc-crm.org) ontology. The aim is manifold: to provide reference implementations to be used by institutions and projects not familiar with [CIDOC-CRM](cidoc-crm.org), to create usable guidelines to generate input interfaces for born-CRM semantic data and to guide mapping processes from extant sources into the CRM conformant reference model using tools such as 3M.

The Semantic Reference Data Models are produced by the **more info here** and describe the following entities:


* [Person](Person.md)
* [Artist](Artist.md)
* [Photographer](Photographer.md)
* [Work](Artwork.md)
* [Photo](Photo.md)
* [Place](Place.md)
* [Repository](Institution.md)



Each of the Models listed above present an initial introduction of the sources and the methodology used for grounding the model. Following this introduction, each descriptor is defined, and its modelling is provided in textual, graphical form and RDF representation.
